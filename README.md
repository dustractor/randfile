usage:

    py randfile.py <source> <dest>

works best with AutoHotKey

example of what to put in your ahk script:

    #F12:: Run, c:\Python37\python.exe c:\users\yourname\wherever_you_put\randfile.py F:\wtf c:\users\yourname\Desktop
    
so then pressing win+f12 puts a random file from wtf to your desktop
